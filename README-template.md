## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I only started to learn coding recently, and to be honest I thought that I had some knowledge about it so far. But truth to be told, once I started working on this project I realised I know jacksheeznit about it. So I had to adapt and overcome. I started learning on the go. I got stuck on this project for more than I really wanted but quitting was not an option. So I learned a lot about CSS, HTML on the go. Positioning, using flexbox, using grid, HTML markup etc.

### Continued development

I want to stick to HTML and CSS for a little while because I know I need to learn a lot, I want to get into some basics of Java Script too in near future. But since CSS and HTML are BASE of the webpage I feel like I should stick to it for a bit more and get a good grasp about the concept and basics.

### Useful resources

I found a lot of solution for the problems I encountered working on this project on two youtube channels. These two content creators/coders are really something.
